Fight or Flight ? : Evolutionary Medical Structure of Immunology, its Philosophical Implications
Jongduck Choi
The aim of my paper is to interpret diverse relations between host and parasite by integrating evolutionary medicine and immunology. An immunological thinking could be reconstructed by specific metaphors such as ‘fighting’, ‘killing’, ‘protection’, ‘immune evasion’, ‘seizure’, or ‘coexistence’. The response of infectious microbes against the host’s attack, where the strained relations between microbes and immune system are activating, directs toward for their own surviving and reproducing through the incessant mutations of microbes as like bacteria and virus do. I will hereby show that the very philosophical category of evolutionary immunology might be formed through my thesis. It is to be unfolded as below. Firstly, I will arrange the evolutionary etiology. Secondly, I show that infectious diseases could be explained well by using the immunological metaphors. Thirdly, the relation between an evolutionary mutation of parasite and immunological activation of host will be illuminated by the concrete cases such as antibiotic, vaccine, and AZT. Fourthly, it will be highlighted that the evolution speed of mutation’s rate for infectious virus exceeds the capacity of horotelic human’s immunity. Lastly, it will be recognized that antibiotic biomedicine or antiviral medicine ultimately do not succeed in doing their role. So I suggest the necessity of medical preparation with concept of coalescence between human and microbes. My conclusion is that medical preparation of that kind of coalescence can be found in the integration of evolutionary medicine and cell based immunology.

History of the Evolutionary Medicine 
And Its Applicability To Medical Education 
Choi, Jongduck
<abstract>
The purpose of this paper is to show direction how historical epistemology of the evolutionary medicine and functionalistic methodology of clinical medicine can be integrated. In order to carry out the purpose, I, first of all, describe the history of evolutionary thinking which has been emerged in the first half of the 19th century. Second, I arrange the evolutionary theory which has been established by Charles Darwin, by the viewpoints of the medical affairs. Third, it is covered in my demonstration how the Darwin’s evolutionary theory had been distorted in socially and medically eugenics. I show that the evolutionary theory had been falsely represented in the name of ‘medical Darwinism’, which called by Zampieri. I furthermore clarify how and why the duration of medical Darwinism could have lasted for the 60 years just before WW II. Then, hereby, I exhibit the details of the epistemological base and etiology of the evolutionary medicine. Lastly I analyze the reasons why the evolutionary medicine has been excluded in the clinical medicine. If those reasons can be clarified, it would be useful for the evolutionary medicine to enter into current curriculum of medical education as well. This paper aims ultimately to examine those possibilities.

In my view, philosophy of medicine can be composed of topic-centered domain, which focuses philosophically on the practical problems of medicine and normative domain, which deals with foundational theories and methodological thesis in medicine. My paper concerns just a normative domain of philosophy of medicine. The so called normative domain contains the three sorts of problems of philosophy of medicine; first point about whether the philosophy of medicine has its own and irreducible field, second issue over how to define disease, and last problem of disputes between the biomedical model and the humane or humanistic model. The normative domain including the diverse philosophical arguments in medicine already has been covered for the past 40 years by Wulff, Schwartz, Pellegrino, Marcum, King, Cunningham, Huneman, Douglas, Engelhardt, Boorse, Caplan, and et cetera. My article is not to solve a disputable problem or not to suggest new issue additionally in the philosophy of medicine, but to commit a reconfiguration the existing arguments in order to organize these diverse arguments in an easily accessible manner. I therefore tried to figure out the epistemological map of the philosophy of medicine, which could find a way to generate a good text of philosophy of medicine in Korean knowledge territory.

"Cognitive Scientific Analysis on Lack of Empathy in Korean Society",2015-06-30,"Epoche and Philosophy","
<Abstract>
There has been super-abuses for the last decade in Korean society. These are ①Four Rivers Project, ②Enforcement of Nuclear Power Plant, ③Booming Household Debt, ④Collapse of the public, and ⑤Sewol Ferry tragedy. I named them “Five Major Social Catastrophes in Korea”, Which is abbreviated as “Five Catastrophes”. The main purpose of this study is to elucidate the social cognitive causes of “Five Catastrophes”. So I will describe that the Five Catastrophes are resulted from separatism, disregarding for life, secrecy, and political deceitfulness, which has been exposed under autocratic Korean authority. Next I will argue that these autocratic phenomena are typical figures of the lack of empathy. I, therefore, demonstrate that the syndrome of Five Catastrophes are deeply related with the symptoms of the lack of empathy. In order to justify my demonstration, neuroscientific microanalysis and macroapproach will be applied. I present the theory of mind(ToM) and mirror-neuron system(MNS) as a neuroscientific analysis and Social Psychologist, Jonathan Haidt’s theory of five foundations of Morality as a social approach. Finally, I suggest a theoretical alternative to extend and share the public empathy in Korean society.

Scientific preconditions 

 
This paper concerns the relationship between religion and evolutionary science. Evolutionary theory offers some important concepts such as variation, adaptation, and selection. Variation signifies that there are different observable characteristics in every offspring and that offsprings differ at their genetic traits. For example, even though a female ocean sunfish(Mola mola) spawns as many as 300 million eggs at a time, none of eggs is identical at the DNA sequencing. Some individuals survive and produce their offsprings which is called survival and reproduction ‘adaptation’. Natural selection depicts a gradual process of biological traits being adapted, inherited and more common in a population while individuals are interacting with their environment.
We have a major theory that natural selection can be accomplished at the level of individuals or genes. However, there are other theories on units of selection such as group level selection or multi-level selection. Multi-level selection is a theory embracing both individual selection and group selection depending on biological circumstances. Fierce debates among evolutionary biologists on the level of selection pressures has been carried out for several decades. After all, group selection theory disappeared since the eminent evolutionary biologist George C. Williams published his book <Adaptation and Natural Selection> in 1966. Group selection theory was formerly considered to be a major theory that explained altruistic human behaviors. However, the evolutionary biologists such as Hamilton, Trivers, and Dawkins, following G. Williams, claimed to explain cooperative or helpful human behaviors sufficiently without group selection theory.
 
However, group selection theory has been regenerated as multi-level selection theory. The multi-level selectionists such as E. Sober insist that selective pressures does not only act at the level of individuals and genes but also act at the level of groups. Traditionally, individual selection theory seemed good enough to explain a biological selfishness and group selection theory seemed good enough to explain a biological altruism. The biological altruism could be defined as; my behaviour is altruistic (i) if my behavior is not to give benefits to myself but to others or a group which I belong to and (ii) if my behavior is helpful not at increasing my reproduction but at increasing others’ reproduction. This definition of biological altruism implies that group selection is the driving factor in the evolution of altruism, even though individual-genetic selectionists explain altruism as a cooperative and compensatory behaviour-traits.
 
2. Is religion a product of evolutionary adaptation?
 
When evolutionists deal with religion, they usually focus on a question whether religion is a biological product or a cultural by-product. In other words, is religion a product of evolutionary adaptation or a byproduct of evolution? David Sloan Wilson as a leading adaptationist of religion argues that religion is based on the theory of multi-level selection that includes group selection.(DS Wilson 2002) The adaptationists who insist only the theory of individual selection instead of group selection argue that evolutionary characters of religion can be explained through the concept of inclusive fitness. According to them, Human religious cognition and behaviour are based evolutionally on maximization of inclusive fitness and consideration of the concept of God as represented by one’s circle of kin and one’s higher-level groups of social salience(Alexander 2013.).
 
On the other hand, there are anti-adaptationists such as cognitive scientist Paul Bloom. According to Bloom, religion is a kind of by-product and a unique kind of cultural inclinations evolved through other adaptations. Religion is, Bloom said, an evolutionary accident(Bloom 2012, 185). Atran who is called a strong anti-adaptationist on religion asserts that “religion can appear as collection of ‘spandrels’ that culture has patched together for no obvious purpose.“ He rejects an idea that religion has any adaptive function as a complete behavioral complex(Atran 2002).
 
However, religion is an inevitable and necessary culture although it is from accident or a collection of spandrels. In other words, religion is a inevitable product from the cultural aspect although religion is a by-product from the biological aspect. Dow particularly pronounced that “it is most probable that social selection is the means by which religion has evolved(Dow 2008).” This view is also true in the case of co-evolution of cultural system and biological system. Many co-evolutioists propose that genes and cultures do not evolve independently on isolated tracks.(Lumsden and Wilson 1981)
 
I suggest that a typical human trait driven by the force of co-evolution is abstract thinking. It might be that imaginations about transcendences such as myths, religious thoughts, metaphysical thoughts such as philosophy and conceptual idealizations such as science and mathematics evolutionally originated from abstract thinking of human being. So we can regard the abstract thinking as a propensity to establish the a priori from a posteriori.

<Abstract>

From Developmental System Theory  To Developmental System Medicine

Choi, Jongduck

The purpose of this article is to examine the possibility of materializing Developmental System Medicine(DSM) whose concept is inferred from the Developmental System Theory(DST). The DSM is not yet an established type of medicine, and I will try to provide arguments on how to draw this new type of medical practice from biological theory. DSM is discriminated from the ‘developmental medicine for disabilities’. DSM is to do with realms of epigenetics, evo-devo, and the DST. DSM can be defined as a medical science whose purpose is to find epigenetical variables due to DST. DST can be characterized by two notions of developmental plasticity and developmental constraint. Developmental plasticity, which is vital to the DST, is an inner-ability for correction and modulation on organism’s traits, coping with its environment after birth. Developmental constraint is a biological inertia to sustain homeostasis and limitation of morphological variations. I will argue that DSM can be defined as a deriative of DST, employing the concept of ‘constructivist interactionism’ conceived by Gray, and the concept of ‘match’, conceived by prof. Gluckman. I will also provide some cases of the apoptosis in order to show a possible physical application of DSM and its possible capacity to help extend the efficiency of existing clinical medicine.

Key Words: Developmental System Medicine, Developmental System Theory(DST), Epigenetics, Constructivist Interactionism, Apoptosis

 Evolutionary Activeness of the Immune Self,
Philosophy of Medicine(The Journal of the Korean Association for Philosophy of Medicine) Nr.15(2013), 39-65, in Korean

 Choi, Jongduck

<Abstract>
The immunology has been understood as a defense mechanism. The defense mechanism means how to protect self against non-self. The defense mechanism is regarded as passive responses with micro-physiological functions to check and keep away foreign invaders. This paper argues that the immune system does not contain the defense mechanism only but also the immunologic activeness. In order to make my points, I offer a philosophical homology between evolutionary thinking and immune system. This paper therefore draws on evolutionary relevances and proofs of immunologic cases. In section 2, I explain why evolutionary thinking is important at immune system. Furthermore, I will try to bear out the validity of the immunologic activeness by the examples of immune specificity, immunologic memory and immune tolerance in section 3. My goal here is to argue that the immunologic activeness is an evolutionary product that was adapted from passive immune prototype.

Arts World of Kim Bong-Joon
(Jongduck Choi, Sangji Univ.)




1. Listening to his arts

Kim’s paintings and sculptures can’t be defined in one genre. Kim devoted himself to poster arts xylographs tinted with strong propaganda and will of struggle against Korean military dictatorship in 80s, Soon he moved to glide across the oil painting and his very own genre of wash-drawing and terra cotta. By ‘his own’, this means Kim’s unique way of making clay arts. Kim does not ‘sculpture’ out of one lump of materials. He piles up the noodle shaped clay into a model, a way of making Korean jar, Hang-a-ri. So the completed piece is void inside, just like a jar.

Kim’s art is a world with multi-national and cross-cultural inspirations. The general theme of his art can be stated in one word, singreum(fertile+generous). Kim’s life itself is endowed with theme of his art. He literally lived art. He danced and practiced music of Korean traditions when he was in the twenties. His arts became aesthetical fertility through experiences like that. When he was in his thirties, he lived as a member of The Farmers and Laborers group who held the pain of Korea’s extremely rapid growth. In the same way, his arts has evolved to the imagination of substantial generosity through his labor movements. He sought to build a good community derived from a humane origin through his art. Kim found this origin in myth.

Kim, Bong-Joon’s aesthetical Basics



Kim Bong-Joon paints history. The essence of his art lies in his expression of human lives. The archetype of life which Kim seeks for is in myths. This myths belong not only to the ancients but also to the laborers, farmers and salariats of today’s ordinary life. And he ia a painter with great narrative power. His arts are constructed by the scenes with narrative varieties which embraced more stories than novels. His arts of myth was created by this narrative type

His aspiration for this myth among people was intense in his art but the mainstream of Korean art society at first did not spot him. Kim himself states that he is the outsider. He says, “My life as an outsider is like a fate, but I always wanted to be an creative outsider.” Kim sometimes finds this creativity among Shamanism of East Asia. He says a new way of peace movement can be made from East Asian archetype of shamans and their rituals. Ideas of cultural pluralism, respect for life, and spiritual equality derived from this archetype run through his art. The aesthetical soul of singreum carved in Kim’s art manifests the freedom from the masculinity, materialism and despotism.

2. Listened by You

His work is a folk art bridging the tradition and the present. In his xylograph, siseohwa(paining with poetry and calligraphy). and terra cotta runs an unity with Japanese folk art. East Asian universality lies in his work.” (Furukawa Mika, Japanese fine arts critic)

An aesthetic of hope found in Sin-myung(East Asian Cheerfulness of spiritual rising). This Sin-myung and vitality is the key of his art.” (Jung Hyun-Sang, Hankyoreh reporter, oct, 2011)

Kim’s artistic objects have been from students and laborers of 80s and democratization movements to farmers and folk lives. However his aspiration for expressing humans has been permanent.” (Asahi news, nov. 2011, exhibition report from gallery ‘Maki’)

Kim constructs a model of harmony between culture and religion formed into a peaceful reform of cultures and religion along the silk-road. The civilization of peace is emerging in Asia. It is based on the mutual respect, which is an attitude of finding the likeness rather than insisting one’s absolute values.” (Volker Kuster, Professor of Kampen Theological Univ. 『Visual Arts and Religion』)



3. Listen his works up




<No way out> xylograph, 1982
The jobless who can’t even be the part-timers. The laborer at the edge is the symbol of Korean industrializations’s shadow. The work was a poster for Kim’s exhibition in Germany in 1987. 


<Deportation of Koreans> mural, 2004
Koreans in the Maritime Province were deported to Siberia in 1937 and it was the most tragic incident in Korean Diaspora. 300 thousands of Koreans who lived in the Maritime were deserted in Siberia under the dictatorship of Stalin. Kim directed a stage work ‘Maritime Welcome’ in 2004. He painted Koreans in a cargo train while the production of the stage work.


  <White Birch forest path> oil painting no.15. 2012
A divine power is found in the forest. Joseph Campbell states that mythos is a divine power, Kim manifests in his art that the divine power is the singreum. When waling in the forest, the divine power rises instantly and spontaneously.


<So-tan Mountain> oil painting no.100. 2012
Terra myth of Kangwondo province : An ox on the top of the mountain, survived from the flood, is an archetype of life. Flood mythologies are ubiquitous in all over the world, Korea’s very own is depicted in the painting.

<Immigration of nomads> silkscreen colored xylograph, 1995
Kim’s journey to West Silk Road was an event of his art life. Asia was common in the mode of paintings. This commoness found in Bedouins inspired Kim as a divinity of nomads.



<Allmother, Allfather – myth of terra> terra cotta, 2000
Mankind saw the earth as the mother and the father. Our fate of being born from, feeding on, and returning to the earth is expressed in our myth of ‘mother earth’. Peace can be found in the civilization of goddesses.

<After the trace of Goddess Civilization> work no.120
Peace is not found in the increase of arms but in the return to the Goddess Civilization. When we end the dogma of masculist religions, can we meet the great civilization of goddess in the ancient times. The ancient traces of goddesses inspired Kim in his journey to West Silk Road in 1995.

Historical Contingency and Historical Constraints in Evolutionary Process, Korean Journal For The Philosophy Of  Science, vol.15-1(2012) 25-53 in Korean

<abstract>
This paper presents an analyse of a causal argument in biological processes of evolution. Beatty’s concept of causality in evolution will be explained with Gould’s notion of historical contingency. Beatty has argued the idea that the historical contingency and causal-dependency are complementary to each other. I will show furthermore that their complementarity can be realized through my own concept of “historical constraints”. The idea of “historical constraints” can be defined as an evolutionary processes relying on the triangle-constructed idea consisted of (1) the concept of physical constraints of developmental biology, (2) Gould’s notion of historical contingency, and (3) Beatty’s notion of causal-dependency. I will argue that the notion of historical constraints would help to bridge between discontinuous processes in macro-evolution and continuous causation of micro-evolution. Historical constraints did not happen in random drift nor in proximate causation. It might give a new approach for the finding of ultimate causation in the evolutionary-geographical history. I furthermore try to accord the reversibility of physical constraints with the irreversibility of evolutionary process. Consequently I argue that the concept of historical constraints can unify the dichotomy between the micro-evolutionary causal mechanism and the modality of macro-evolutionary contingency in one explanatory spectrum.

Key Words: Historical Contingency, Historical Constraints, Complexity of Causation, Irreversibility, Continuity of Evolution

Science of Aging: From Idol Theories To Common Theories, Philosophy of Medicine(The Journal of the Korean association for philosophy of medicine) Nr.11(2011), 57-79, in Korean

<abstracts>
This paper presents a critical argument against rosy expectations of the ageing on the basis of ideal theories. Dream of Eternal Youth lasted as the greatest desire of human being up to now from ancient times. Modern Science is trying to find out a silver-bullet for a longevity and healthy ageing. Biological medicine therefore is offering so many advanced theories of ageing in order to accomplish the physiological goal. I called them “idol theories” in a view that they can get into commercial tools unfortunately. Some theories of ageing might turn out to be true someday. But surely many of them that claim to solve the problem of ageing ended up just ad-hoc componential theories. In my article I will show that the so called “idol theory” could not be a one-to-one correspondent theory between theory and symptom/gene on ageing. The goal of this article is to search for the possible correlations among so-called idol theories and come up with a new insight on ageing both scientifically and philosophically. A lot of ultrafashionable idol theories can be necessary but not sufficient conditions for the scientific explanation of ageing. Even if we had a bunch of sufficient theories on ageing, we should also have another theory of common sense that our real life depend upon and is derived from, I argue philosophically that the common sense theory is more important than the idol theories in order to better our life.

<abstract>

This paper draws on the problem whether the evolutionary theory of adaptation could explain how the psychological phenomenon of self-deception works. The successful self-deception is even imaginary phenomenon externally, but it can be kept with highly internal consistency since it is treated as very actual and real thing for myself. Self-deception is the process or fact of misleading ourselves to accept as true or valid what is false or invalid. Self-deception is a way we justify false beliefs to ourselves.

Greenwald explain the self-deception through his concept “beneffectance”, which is selectively perceived as responsible for desired, but not undesired, outcomes. Since then, evolutionary psychologists have, beyond the shadow of a doubt, interpreted the “self-deception” entirely as the theory of adaptation. According to the theory of adaptation, self-deceit is natural, that is, not only not pathological but positively beneficial to organism as they navigate their natural and social environments in the struggle for existence.

On the contrary, in my article I sketched the another interpretations beyond theory of adaptation which had became a dominant interpretation. I conclude that self-deception may be not an adaptation, but a byproduct of human cognitive traits.

This is trial research to explore natural historical foundation of Tao and Chi beyond mataphysical Approach. First of all I explain idea and modes of Chi is very closed to the geopolitical environment and the geological conditions which were born. The concept of Tao has much more strong mataphysical image with regard to concept of Chi. And I emphasize even the image of Tao reflect the aspect when Chi is in best movement as well. Finally I will show that Tao and Chi are not given by Supreme in apriorial meaning, but they are in themselves the active principles as well as the empirical movements which are natural products at the same time. I call the characters of Tao and Chi the natural evolutional thinking in eastasian philosophical meaning.

The Immunological and Social Criticism On the Human Embryonic Cloning Technology in Korea.   Democratic Society and policy Studies vol.9(2006) 213-230 in Korean

abstract
The excellent results of the human embryonic cloning technology in Korea, considered intuitively, get joined on the national pride, but flop over to the borderline of science. This paper draws critically on the current Korean syndrome of nationalism in the cloning technology from the standpoint of immunological philosophy and social angle. In section 2, I’ll argue that immunological research is not an additional process, but a imperative major subject in the embryonic cloning research. The realistic success on the therapeutic uses of embryonic stem cells relies on the recognizing of the immunological identity thesis. In order to overcome the immune rejection problems associated with organ and tissue transplants, researcher should be free himself from the reductionist attitude of ‘immune-self’ concept. In section 3, I offer a critical analysis of the commercial misuse of stem cell and cloning. Large scale research cloning could generate a market for women’s eggs that could easily lead to exploitation. Furthermore I’ll show why embryonic stem cell patents may be a commercial issue that will offer a criterium of exchange value. In conclusion, I address that our hope of stem cell should be taken to allow for a medical future. We must keep watch the nationalism or commercialism in science in order to protect our hope from being hype.

Abstract:
This paper presents the correlation between medicine and culture by illumination on the placebo effect. The Placebo phenomenon is of course not the domain of biomedicine, but actually gives the practical effects in medicine. I termed the social collectiveness of individual placebo effects ‘cultural synergism’. The placebo as psychological elements of the cultural synergism entails the following manifolds of placebo-spectrum whether for positive or for negative: i)placebo test as a scientific method, ii)placebo by authority, iii)placebo by image, iv)placebo by folklore and v)placebo by capital. I conclude my analysis of the placebo-spectrum shall demonstrate the cultural synergism of medicine.

Philosophical Reflections On Social Systems For the Low Degree of Dispersion. The Journal of Korean Philosophical Society No.99(2006), 367-382, in Korean

<Abstract>
The Structure of decision making in the social system is classified into the autocratic centered structure and the diverse dispersion structure according to how many more ways of communications the society has got. Furthermore the dispersion society is classified into the low degree of dispersion and the high degree of dispersion. The society of the high degree of dispersion is characterized as twofold: the main structure such like neo-liberalistic societies and developmental societies. I suggest hereby the philosophical possibility of the low degree of dispersion in order to remedy abuses of the autocratic society of high degree of dispersion. The content of philosophical possibility that give emphasis to the realization of social values instead of political measures is a actual policy such like disentangle of economic extremities in Korea to stabilize the people’s livehood. It is a main theme of this article that the egalitarianism policy of low degree of dispersion is a sustain approach to the realization of social values.

I propose that the actual communication between the medicine and philosophy has to be necessary. In this article, I explicate the account of how medical educations come to (1) understand an introspection on human and (2) reflect a synthetical view of our society. It is my first process to recognize the crucial difference between the concept of explanation and the meaning of understanding. It attempts to overcome this difference, on the one hand by taking into account the body as the object of explanations, and on the other hand by embedding the body into an social living of organized dynamical systems. Both philosophical introspection and social reflection should not be abstract, but be applicable to medical practices. This paper treats the Evidence-Based Medicine(EBM) and the Problem-Based Learning(PBL) as the applicable cases.

abstract
I mention strongly there seems to be dual human nature between internal effortless intention (wu-weidirected nature) and external actuality intention. This article analyses the manifolded stratification of concept of wu-wei. I focused upon the wu-wei concept of Huainanzi(淮南子) specially, which embraces the confucian character and the taoistic nature together. This syncretism which associated with the Huainanzi in particular by me, entails a duplicity in human nature between internal effortless intention (wu-wei directed nature) and external actuality intention. Furthermore, I tried to explain that my duplicity model of human nature is based on the naturalistic interpretation of evolutionary adaptationism. The structure of the taoistic wu-wei concept is itself an foundation of “Huang-Lao(黃老學) and has an implication of external actuality trait. I called it “socialization of mind”. My article emphasizes that the duplicity of human nature, derived from the taoistic wu-wei concept, could be born out by the evolutionary adaptationism, since the internal effortless mind and external actuality mind are the evolutionary psychological traits which were independently adapted.

– ABSTRACT –
  The Possibility of Biological Altruism

In my article, I research the possibility of biological altruism. I will show that altruism is advantageous at the group level. Therefore, altruists will be at a selective disadvantage compared with their selfish individuality, but the fitness of the group as a whole will be enhanced. I will work for my ultimate contention that biological altruism could be one of the most important sources foran understanding of human morality.
An organism is regarded altruistic when its behavior benefits other organisms at a cost to itself. The costs and benefits are measured in terms of the reproductive fitness for natural selection. If an organism behaves altruistically, it may reduce the number of its own offspring, but tends to boost other organisms’ reproduction. A behavior is altruistic when it increases the fitness of others and decreases the fitness of actor
I argue that altruism is advantageous at the group level. A group containing lots of altruists, each ready to subordinate their own selfish interests for the greater good of the group, may well have an advantage for survival over a group composed mainly or exclusively of selfish organisms. A process of between-group selection may thus prompt altruistic behavior to evolve. Within each group, altruists will be at a selective disadvantage compared with their selfish colleagues, but the fitness of the group as a whole will be enhanced by their presence. Therefore, it is the ultimate object in my project to theorize that biological altruism is possible in nature through the evolution of pure group selection.
Furthermore, I will show how biological altruism can apply to psychological altruism or human morality. The theories of psychological altruism propose that empathic concern evokes an altruistic motivation. Studies supporting the theories have systematically varied whether individuals can only obtain egoistic goals by helping, or whether they can escape from the situation and obtain the egoistic goals without helping.

A Philosophical Reflection on the Biological Identiy

– abstract –

The research of the stem cell heads toward a revolutionary development in genetic therapeutics. But we must have a attention its ethical problems. At this point, we would make a social agrement or legally contract, as like a prohibition of embryo-research for a reproductive purpose, a sufficiently informed consent of embryo donation or no financial inducements etc, .But it need more, I think, a ontological question; such like what biological self is.

The Philosophical approach of Stem Cell Research shall be consider the difference between the substantial view of traditional identity and relational view of biological identity. Through the substantial view of identity, we have got a knowledge the physical entities. But we must use the relatedness-oriented Identity concept, if we take a situation on the biological entities such as a stem cell. My article will be show that the relational concept of Identity may be worthwhile for the stem cell research, because of its immunological interactions.

A stem cell is a special kind of cell that has a unique capacity to renew itself and to give rise to specialized cell types. Researchers hope that the study of human stem cell will lead to a better understanding of cell function, cell differentiation, and human development. Standing in the way of research are questions about how we should use human embryos. For those who view embryos as human lives deserving of the same respect as a child or adult, research that kills embryos is no more acceptable than would be research that killed adults. For those who view embryos as a collection of cells akin to other human tissue, research is acceptable and relatively uncontroversial.

Embryonic stem(ES) cells and adult stem cells have different functions and characteristics. Embryonic stem cells come from embryos formed by in-vitro fertilization of a human sperm and germ. Embryonic stem cells can become all cell types of the body because they are pluripotent. In contrast, adult stem cells can be harvested from the blood, bone marrow and tissue of adults. Adult stem cells are but generally limited to differentiating into different cell types of their tissue of origin. It’s unclear also, whether adult stem cells will prove as versatile as embryonic ones. The use of the patient’s own adult stem cells would mean that the cells would relatively not be rejected by the immune system. This represents a significant advantage as immune rejection is a difficult problem that can only be circumvented with immunosuppressive drugs.

There are various immunological issues with embryonic stem cells. Immunological rejection is likely to be an important problem. Little attention has been paid to the immunogenicity of transplanted fetal or ES-cell-derived tissues or to the need for immunosuppression. Overcoming the immune response must have a prominent role in the development of hES-cell therapeutics. It also means that the need for fetal and adult cells as a source of stem cells for medical research may soon be eclipsed by the more readily available and less controversial adult stem cells. It may be provable that the problem of immune rejection may also be circumvented if an individual’s own adult cells can be used. But in order to solve fundamentally this problems, we must approach the philosophical understanding of a biological identity. For scientist’s experimental approach could not avoid unexpected additional immunosuppressions.

A choice is normally dependent on situations. A choice situation and an agent’s motives are interwoven with each other. And his motives are rooted in traditional customs, social structures, and the present scientific-technological standards, etc., which all construct his world view. Someone might try to find a rational choice criterion without considering agent’s motives. But such a trial is comparable to the man claiming that he has 200 million dollars in a heavenly bank. An agent’s world view cannot be ignored in a choice situation, as a real bank cannot be a heavenly bank. Now, let agents be various cultural groups. Some dominant groups might easily exercise their privilege in the present economic global process, whereby cultural conflicts cannot be avoidable. The result of such conflicts is a cultural conservatism which is not suitable for the scientific-technological world. All groups want to be co-evolutionary. A necessary condition for cultural co-evolution is a comparative studies not based on external observable similarities between cultural groups, but on similarities and dissimilarities in the views of nature. Therefore, our cognition of the differences between the Western and traditional East-Asian thought on nature can really aim for an inter-cultural communication and consolidation. And we have to be against

1. Various modes of conflict in the scientific-technological era

We say and hear that we are living in a scientific-technological world. How can this world be understood? We cannot define the meaning of the terms ‘scientific’ and ‘technological’ exactly. However, there must be some peculiarities attributable to our scientific-technological era. Two main peculiarities have been often pointed out by theoreticians. One is that the traditional distinction between science and technology or between theoretical knowledge and technological knowledge, held since Aristotle, can be seriously scrutinized. The other is that the value neutrality of science and technology cannot be accepted, because the scientific-technological world is on the one hand very dangerous and on the other hand needs new norms in human social activities. These two peculiarities are not the main focus of this short article. We rather point out the following peculiarities which have not been dealt with seriously in recent times:

1. the intrinsic conflicts inside various scientific theories
2. the cultural conflicts caused by various scientific-technological standards

Let us analyse the above two kinds of conflicts. In order to understand the first kind of conflict, we should not regard a somewhat well established scientific theory merely as a formal representation. For example, Newtonian absoluteness of space and time was not something verifiable or refutable by observed facts, but a metaphysical presupposition. Therefore, a philosophical understanding of nature or a world view is implicit in a scientific theory. We now live in a house of various scientific theories, hence in various world views, even if we all are not explicitly conscious of this fact. Not all world views are compatible and coherent with each other. The methodological approach of molecular biology and the philosophical picture of modern immunology are so different that integrating them into one view is not probable. Their conflicts, based on the differences between molecular reductionism and evolutionary thought, go back to the late 19th century debates between humorlists and E. Metchnikoff.

The intrinsic conflicts inside various scientific theories did not explicitly appear in the past in which the traditional scientific world view was dominant. This kind of conflict can be nowadays extended to the cultural domain. For example, East-Asian and Western medicine are both now practiced in Korea, whereby Korean medicine cannot exercise its traditional privilege. Western medicine was not accessible to ordinary people in traditional East-Asian culture, as the East-asian medicine was unknown to Western people.

The second kind of conflict is the cultural conflict caused by various scientific- technological standards, as DNA testing in criminal cases. This kind of conflict is somewhat different from the first kind. We have developed or are developing various scientific-technological standards applicable to actual choice situations, for example to technological assessment. Various scientific-technological standards are potentially applicable with respect to one choice situation. However, only one such standard will be selected normally, whereby a dominant science plays an important role. An important question is by which factors the dominance of competing scientific theories will be defined with respect to a choice situation. Scientific objectivity cannot be the only criterion for resolving the question because of the intrinsic conflicts inside various scientific theories. Economic and political factors rather play an important role in making a scientific-technological standard. Application of such a new standard in a society is a highly complex process in which tradition and modernity could conflict with each other.

The system of cultural groups is not homogeneous with respect to their own traits and scientific-technological levels. Thus, the cultural conflicts caused by scientific-technological standards are a world wide problem. Some such standards developed by Western civilization are totally alien to the East-Asian or African culture, largely unnoticed because of its subordinate position in the world market. Metaphorically speaking, many Western dog-lovers hate dog-eaters and call for a world wide prohibition of dog-eating. Consider why the amputation of one arm in the case of car accidents receives the highest compensation money. The reason for it lies in the efficiency of bodily parts in working. That reason might not be fully understood by the people living in inner Mongolia. In some cases, a cultural group is not yet rationally skilled to use certain scientific-technological standards proposed by Western countries.

2. Qualification for world disaster

We remarked about various modes of cultural conflict in the scientific- technological era. Such conflicts are not avoidable in a sense. Who then is qualified to harmonize various cultural groups? It is very difficult to find some rational criteria for that qualification. So, let us ask a satirical question: who is qualified to bring disorder or disaster to the world cultural system? We will not directly designate certain nations, but a type of theoretician or leader etc., the so-called ‘universalists’ who think as follows:

1. Science and technology are only relevant to cultural factors when they are regulated by some social institutions and norms or when we need them to restrict the process of scientific-technological development;
2. There is or might be a universally valid system of cultural values which rational agents in the end will find.


Not only most theoreticians in the period of enlightenment, but also several important current philosophers and activists as J. Habermas, Fukuyama, etc. are regarded as universalists. According to the universalist‘s view, some groups should be subordinated to a rational system of values founded newly in the scientific-technological era, because they are not prepared to participate in rational discourse or too thick-headed to accept it. It is not a surprising fact that the concept of culture played an important role in justifying colonialism. Even if universalists accept universal human rights, their concept of culture could be easily misused to justify cultural discrimination. No wonder that many theoreticians in the period of enlightenment shared the following standpoint:

Those born among a barbarous people have really only ideas relating to their self-preservation. … A proof that they lack ideas is that their languages are all very sterile; not only have they few words, but they have few modes of conceiving and sensing. The fibres of their brains, being little used to being flexed, have become rigid.”

Universalists are surely good utopians but like so-called ‘lawyers without practice’. Culture is an open and dynamic system. Science and technology cannot be separable from a cultural evolution. For example, a calendar system reflects the cosmological world view, symbols, and technological status of a cultural group. Of course, someone might object, claiming that we all now use the Julian calender system, refrigerators, and personal computers. But the methods of using them are different with respect to various cultural groups. The refrigerators in our land are equipped with particular vessels preserving Korean traditional dishes, which could reciprocally develop a new technology. Science and technology evolve with culture, and conversely.

Traditional cultural traits are newly transformed or soak into our scientific-technological era. Not all scientific-technological standards developed by the Western countries are fully transformed into the East-Asian cultural groups. However, those groups are culturally unnoticed by Western countries. Cultural conflicts are here and there. No wonder that the discourse on East-Asian identity has been the center of attention with respect to the problem of cultural conflicts. We should not be universalists in order to co-evolve together or solve the kinds of conflicts remarked in the previous paragraph. We should at first find out the peculiarity and originality of each cultural group largely unnoticed by the Western countries. For a fair game, it may be necessary to check out cultural conflicts in the perspectives of those groups.

3. For a fair game principle

 We are conscious of the fact that there have been other trends such as vitalism in the Western view of nature. But we don’t think that they played an important role in the formation of the present scientific-technological world. We are also conscious of the fact that the traditional East-Asian view of nature cannot be in itself transformed into the modern East-Asian cultural group. The world cultural system is not closed and fixed, whereby the traits of the unnoticed cultural groups cannot be fully coated by those of some dominant groups. Our motive in the previous comparison of the views of nature is not based on the universalist’s view, just on a fair game principle by which cultural conflicts should be seriously reconsidered in the perspective of the groups largely subordinated to the order developed by the dominant groups in the world cultural system.

A fair game principle aims at a deep understanding of differences between various cultural traits in order to find shared goals and evaluative standards. We have to ask the question how western theoreticians can dialectically engage eastern thought, and vice versa, for cultural co-evolution. A common understanding of the philosophical enterprise may or may not be attainable. However, to organize eastern human studies by means of western philosophical categories and to evaluate it by western criteria of evidence, argument and proof is idle as it is parochial. Likewise, it would be absurd to explain modern scientific thinking with the eastern philosophy, despite the dissatisfaction with a western mechanical world view.

An Ecological Imagination and Human Studies in East-Asia
Jongduck Choi (Sangji Univ.,Philosophy)

1. An intercultural consolidation

The discourse on the East-asian identity has been the center of attention in a field of the social and human studies in a recent time. The focus of the discourse pertains to the phenomena of discord or harmony between the east and west. Confrontationists such as S. Huntington and E. Said emphasize crash of two civilizations, while the harmonists such as H. Mueller stresses togetherness(zusammenleben) of the two. These discourses had their own historical and social meanings. These discourses may be inclined to the dividing logic in the struggle or the subordination without sufficient philosophical understanding. Therefore, it is very important to illuminate the problems of identity from the view of natural philosophy.

It may be very dangerous attempt to make a sharp distinction between the West and East to find one’s identity, and to acknowledge this danger is the aim of this paper. Finding one’s identity is a mirroring task, and it is important to explore their peculiarity and originality. A relative peculiarity of Eastern thinking can be found from an ecological view of nature. This essay is based on the East-asian ecological thoughts. Eastern philosophy could play more fundamental role in a multi-cultural society in the future. It is very likely that the traditional East-asian philosophy may become a fashionable alternative to the conventional Euro-american attitudes and values. But comparative studies examining only external similarities between the western and oriental thoughts may lead to a misunderstanding. It would not be wise to conduct a comparative studies on the similarities without having philosophical reflection. The postulation of the rational discrimination between the West and East should not be aimed at separation, but for an inter-cultural communication and consolidation.

2. Scientific view of nature

Through the comparison on the views of nature, we could construct a frame of thinking to discriminate the differences between the Western and traditional East-asian thoughts. The Western concept of Nature is represented in atomism as particulate, material, inert, quantitative, and mechanical paradigm. The Western concept of nature became institutionalized in an early stage of modern science and pragmatically translated into an engineering agenda. However, the so called cultural crisis may, in large part, be diagnosed as a symptom of the atomic-mechanistic image of nature inherited from Greeks, classical science, and modern technology.

Newton mechanics was not just a theory of physics. It was an all-embracing philosophy of the natural world. During the eighteenth century of European scientific enlightenment, what had once been an integral part of natural philosophy evolved into the natural sciences. This is why Democlito’s atomism from the ancient time was easily absorbed into the Newton’s theory. Atomistic thought just expresses the idea that a quantitative method through the mathematical tools is a criterion of the western modernity. The standing rule of quantitative measurement was a philosophical seed of the Industrial Revolution. In the twentieth century scientific technology and industrial capital gave us not only material fertility, but also subsidiary ill effects of alienation. The explosive development of twentieth century technology may be a cause of an alienation and isolation. The alienation of homo sapiens in our modern civilization is at the bottom of the cultural crisis which committed the environmental crisis. That is to say, our crisis is due to the discord between human rationality and human alienation. This discord is revealed in the scientific view of nature. So we must seek to find another view of nature in order to shift from ‘discord’ toward ‘harmony’.

3. Continuum paradigm

Among the views on nature, including the rational system of external and material atomism, we can choose the organistic process thinking about the nature. The process thinking invites a return to the kind of philosophical reflection, which could be a therapy for the human alienation. The relatedness-oriented process thinking may be worthwhile for the humanity. There is a radical difference between the processed world concept and substantial atomism. That is to say, the flow of the organistic process thinking is destructing the philosophical dualism on which the traditional substantialism is built upon; its mind-body and man-nature formulations. From the point of relational process paradigm, the nature is not, as represented in the classical science, an aggregate of substantial independent entities. The relational view of nature is holistic. And organistic feature is the integral part of the man to nature relationship.

Living organisms are preeminent examples of the kind of continuum system that can not be understood by atomistic materialism. Similarly, the relational net of our nature is a kind of continuum system. While a rational order is comparable to the discontinuum system as like collection of atoms, the dynamics of nature can not be captured easily by a rational medium. Unfortunately we are ignorant on how to define a continuum system in details.

We need to turn the thinking process, moving from an object centered substantial view toward a continuum view of nature to congregate between the West and East. In the meeting of East and West, F.S.C. Northrop has pointed out that Eastern thought is much more devoted to continuum view of reality, while the Western thought is much more centered on theoretic constructs, such as an atomistic object. Traditional understanding of human in the West has developed within the Western object-centered atomistic view of reality. To understand a human is not to explain analytically. It is therefore needed to be moved from an analytical discontinuum paradigm of the science to a differentiated continuum paradigm which is much closer to the Eastern philosophy.

The organistic process thinking exhibits three basic motifs: continuity, wholeness, and dynamism. To say that the nature is in a state of continuum and that all of its components are internally connected, means that its organistic unity is integrated holistically at each level with hierarchy. The contiguous flow of nature is characterized by the dynamic change of vital force. The continuum of nature is itself complex, and a wholeness of nature is the optimum functioning of the hierarchial supra-system containing all the subsidiary systems.

While the physical world may be recognized as a closed system, the nature is an open system. Open system, as opposed to closed, is that which ceaselessly interacts with their environment. In the open network there is no external motivation as like god or world-engine. Nature means causa sui in Chinese word. There are only internal relations.

Another character of the internal relation is that there is no difference in quality between the objects and its internal relation. All of the parts of the entire nature belong to one organistic whole, and they all interact as participants in one spontaneously self-generating life process. In the self-generating processes, all things and processes in the world are related in processes which proceed toward a balance and a harmony. So ‘what a thing is’ means ‘how the flow of self-generating force is concentrated’.

Western atomistic realism has an implication that all relations were held to be external. Western rational property can not evoke the imagination of these internal relation. The very radical difference between external relation and internal relation is not easy to explain. Because of this difference, it can be said that internal relation unfortunately cannot be submissive to the terminology of western science.

For example, the traditional medical definition of the Korean word kan as ‘liver’ may be misleading in the context of modern anatomy; the name of organ ‘liver’ is used in Korean medicine to refer to functional systems of which the liver is not merely the physical substrata. This situation is the same in the concept of life. The medical criteria of death is mainly the cessation of the heart-beat or breathing. But in traditional Korean medicine death means that chi (life energy), chung (organic essence) or shin (spirit) is choked or dispersed (not exhausted). Such problems as medical terminology are applicable to all disciplines of Human Studies in Korea.

4. Task of our human studies

We have to ask the question how the western philosophers can dialectically engage eastern thoughts, and vice versa, in order to find shared goals and evaluative standards. The possible answer to this question may be the task of human studies in the East, especially in Korea. A common understanding of the philosophical enterprise may or may not be attainable. However, to organize eastern human studies by means of western philosophical categories and to evaluate it by western criteria of evidence, argument and proof is idle as it is parochial. Likewise, it would be absurd to explain modern scientific thinking with the eastern philosophy, despite the dissatisfaction with a western mechanical worldview.

We can not deny that the western science and the science-based industrial technology have made our life easier, more comfortable and, in some ways, more satisfying. This satisfaction is however gradually turning out to be a dissatisfaction, especially by those who have begun to realize the threat of environmental crisis posed by the increasing demands of the technological world. However we must recognize that the so called human crisis of today is not a western phenomenon alone.

Nobody can be sure whether the East-asian thought is an alternative to the modern civilization. Nevertheless, man has to make an attempt to find a new philosophical therapy. Nowadays the difference between the East and West is not a geographical difference alone. We should not lay the human crisis on the Western civilization alone, but also on the industrialized Asian climate. The alternative is not a revolutionary solution but just concentration of a small cultural improvement. Therefore there is no such thing as perfect alternative. We can not judge by predominance-comparision between the West and East. We can only reconcile both cultures. This is a task of our human studies.

<abstract>
Technological assessment (TA) is a decision-making procedure to estimate the possible social and economic consequences that the application of a new technique will bring about. TA is firmly institutionalized in America and some parts of Europe, whereas public participation in TA is still to be realized at a practical level. One theoretical reason behind th lack of public participation may be found in the utilitarian tradition in the western culture. Consequentialist Model of TA (CQM) regards the viewpoints of the individual citizens as irrelevant th the public utility, because the means are justified only by their end-results.
Discourse-Ethical Model of TA(DM) as a possible alternative to CQM, confined by its own network of theoretical notions, also appears to be inactive as to the public participation in TA.
It is doubtful, whether a formal context-free discourse-reason can be presupposed in our ordinary communication. We come to consider Common-Sense-Model of TA(CSM). The combination of the notions of “acts allowed merely in the ordinary sense” and allowed morally in the ordinary sense” suggests a need of public participation in TA.
But any decisions made by CSM cannot exactly determine the future because the organically intertwined, patterned structure of individuals and the satisfaction of individual desires never seem to agree. The Whiteheadian concept of “togetherness” explains the reasons underlying our life-world that take time evolving a structure in which intrinsic values are accompanied. Then, our ordinary and future-oriented judgments based on those values are a kind of “living occasions” in an organic structure, which is the life-world. There is no sorrow on the part of philosophers in the fact that our actual decision-making is not exactly quantitative in mathematical sense.
The work presented here is at its schematic stage. Further progress and more detailed account will follow in the forthcoming phase of this work.
